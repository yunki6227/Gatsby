    <p>Throughout the story, the story is told by Nick Carraway, a man who moves to New York to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district and happens to have a mysterious neighbor- Jay Gatsby. Every Saturday night, Gatsby is known to throw huge parties in his mansion. We also meet Tom Buchanan, a rich man who is married to Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Nick’s cousin. Tom is seen to have affairs with another woman named Myrtle, without Daisy being aware of it. One night, Nick is personally invited to Gatsby’s party and encounters Gatsby. Eventually, Nick grows fond of Gatsby and learns about his previous relationship with Daisy. Nick learns that Gatsby moved here and threw parties just to marry Daisy from Tom. Because Gatsby wants a reunion with Daisy, Nick invites Daisy and Gatsby to tea at his house, without Daisy knowing Gatsby will be there. At first, the two lovers are extremely awkward. In a short period of time, their love is rekindled, and they begin an affair. Later, Tom grows suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby, and at lunch with Gatsby, Nick, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, he is outraged by the thought that his wife was unfaithful to him. Tom decides to let Gatsby drive Daisy back to East Egg, and during the drive, they hit Myrtle and killed her. Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of that car, and George finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead, then himself. The end of the story shows Nick at a funeral for Gatsby, showing the end of Gatsby’s dream of Daisy.
